# Crypto-Logic in Android Studio




## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of a basic crypto-logic game up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  See 'Installing' and 'Getting the project of the pocket calculator' for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Project Description

The crypto-logic game will randomly select a word from the following:
	* APPLE
	* BANANA
	* CHERRY
	
The game will then scramble the selected dictionary word. The player will be then challenged to guess what the original word will be. The player will perform this but letter by letter all while making as few incorrect guesses as possible. This project was created for Mobile Application Development in Mr. Jay Snellen's class.

This application will contain the following: 

* Array Lists
* Strings
* import java.util.ArrayList;
* import java.util.Arrays;
* import java.util.Collections;
* import android.widget.*; 
* TextView
* Buttons
* Text




### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them 


You will need to install the Android Studio IDE. Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Google. It includes everything that you will need to build and test Android applications. It is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux based operating systems. It was developed and created by Google and JetBrains. Android Studio supports CVS, Git, Google Cloud, Mercurial, and Subversion version control systems. Android Studio has a layout editor with drag and drop user interface components. It supports Android Wear and Android virtual reality applications. Android Studio also contains the Android emulator, Android Virtual Device, that is required to test your applications. There are multiple download options that you can choose if you have other requests. According to the website, "Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device". Android studio allows code from Kotlin, Java, and C/C++ languages. It is recommended that you check if your computer meets the system requirements of Android Studio because it is well-known that Android Studio eats up a lot of memory and RAM in your computer, which can ultimately limit the performance of your computer.

The system requirements for Version 3 are the following: 


* Microsoft® Windows® 7/8/10 (32- or 64-bit)
* 3 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended; plus 1 GB for the Android Emulator.
* 2 GB of available disk space minimum, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)
* 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution.


Things you need to know before working on an Android project

```
You need to have a good understanding of Java programming. You must have a strong grasp of Object Oriented Programming as well. 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running 

Download Android Studio from [this website](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Creating a Project

1. Create a New Project

2. Choose the Basic Activity Option

3. In the Configure Your Project page, use the defaults except for what is below

```
In Minimum API level, uses API 22: Android 5.1 (Lollipop)
```

4. Congratulations, you have created your first project (nothing in it yet).

## Getting the project of the pocket calculator

1. On the top of the tool bar, and go to FILE -> NEW -> Project from Version Control -> Git.

2. Place '[https://github.com/gusztav97/Lab3FinalProject](https://github.com/gusztav97/Lab3FinalProject)' when the prompt asks for the url.

3. You will receive the full project which should be ready to go. It will look like this ![this](https://github.com/gusztav97/MobDev-Project1Francia/blob/master/image.png)

## Running the simulator

There is a green play button around the top-right toolbar.
If you click on it, it will start the Google simulation.
Note: If this is your first time opening the Google simulation, it
will take more than a minute to open. 


## Performance Tests

The following tests should work in the simulator for the word "APPLE".

* Player enters A = 1 Correct Guess, 0 Incorrect Guess
* Player enters R = 0 Correct Guess, 1 Incorrect Guess
